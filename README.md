# Another notes app

![App icon](app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png)

*The app is not actively developed because I have moved away from Android development in recent years.
I'll fix critical bugs, but features may not be implemented before a very long time, if ever. 
Expect one release per year. I will accept and review pull requests though.*

This is a simple Android app for taking notes, like there have been tens of thousands before.
The app has Material UI, was built following MVVM architecture, uses Dagger and some Jetpack
components. Download is available on:
